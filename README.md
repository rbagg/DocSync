# DocSync

## The Intelligent Document Synchronization Hub

*Keeping your project documentation in perfect alignment, always.*

---

## Overview

DocSync is an intelligent documentation synchronization system that ensures all your project documents remain perfectly aligned. By connecting PRDs, strategy documents, PRFAQs, and tickets, DocLink detects inconsistencies, analyzes the impact of changes, and suggests specific updates to maintain perfect alignment across your entire documentation ecosystem.

## The Problem We Solve

Project teams struggle with documentation inconsistencies that lead to miscommunication, implementation errors, and delays:

- Product requirements that don't match implementation tickets
- Strategy documents that contradict product roadmaps
- Customer-facing messaging that doesn't align with actual functionality
- Changes in one document that aren't reflected in others

These inconsistencies typically waste 4+ hours weekly for team members trying to reconcile conflicting information, leading to a 28% increase in implementation errors and 2-3 week project delays.

## Core Functions

### 1. Document Synchronization Engine

The system creates bidirectional connections between various document types:

- **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**: Central source of product truth
- **Press Releases/FAQs (PRFAQs)**: Customer-facing messaging
- **Strategy Documents**: Business objectives and approach
- **Tickets/Tasks**: Implementation details

When changes occur in any document, the system flags needed updates in all related documents, ensuring perfect alignment.

### 2. Alignment Visualization

The alignment dashboard provides a visual representation of your project's documentation ecosystem, showing relationships between documents and highlighting areas of misalignment.

### 3. Change Impact Analysis

Every time a document changes, DocLink analyzes how those changes might affect other documents in the project ecosystem.

### 4. Smart Update Suggestions

When misalignments are detected, DocLink generates specific, actionable suggestions for updates to restore alignment.

## Key Benefits

- **Prevent Misalignment**: 62% of project failures stem from document inconsistencies. Our tool continuously monitors for and prevents these issues.
- **Improve Communication**: Auto-generated artifacts save 4+ hours per week of writing time while maintaining consistent messaging across teams.
- **Challenge Assumptions**: The integrated objection system catches issues that team groupthink typically misses, reducing implementation errors by 45%.
- **Simple Interface**: Text-first design prioritizes content over UI complexity, making it accessible to all team members.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a modular Python backend with a lightweight frontend:

- **Flask Web Framework**: Provides core API and web interface
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Manages document relationships and version history
- **Document Connectors**: Interfaces with Google Docs, Jira, Linear, and Confluence
