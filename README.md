# DocSync

## AI-Powered Document Alignment with Self-Critique Technology

*Keep your project documents perfectly aligned with intelligent analysis in under 60 seconds*

---

## Overview

DocSync uses advanced AI self-critique technology to analyze alignment between your project documents and provide actionable suggestions for perfect consistency. Connect PRDs, tickets, strategy docs, and customer messagingâ€”then receive intelligent analysis of how well they align.

**The difference:** Our AI doesn't just analyze onceâ€”it critiques its own alignment analysis and creates enhanced suggestions, delivering significantly higher quality insights.

## The Problem We Solve

Project teams struggle with document misalignment that leads to miscommunication, implementation errors, and delays:

- Product requirements that don't match implementation tickets
- Strategy documents that contradict product roadmaps  
- Customer-facing messaging that doesn't align with actual functionality
- Changes in one document that aren't reflected in others

These inconsistencies typically waste 4+ hours weekly for team members trying to reconcile conflicting information, leading to a 28% increase in implementation errors and 2-3 week project delays.

## How DocSync Works

### **Smart Processing Based on Project Complexity**
- **Simple analysis** (basic projects) â†’ Fast alignment check (1 API call)
- **Self-critique enhancement** (complex projects) â†’ Enhanced analysis (3 API calls)

### **Self-Critique Technology for Alignment**
1. **Generate** initial alignment analysis between documents
2. **Critique** the AI's own analysis to identify accuracy issues
3. **Enhance** the final suggestions based on self-identified improvements

This process delivers dramatically better alignment suggestions than single-pass AI analysis.

## Core Features

### ðŸ”— **Document Connection**
- **Google Docs** - PRDs, strategy documents, PRFAQs
- **Jira & Linear** - Implementation tickets and tasks

### âš¡ **Smart Processing**
- **Automatic complexity detection** - chooses optimal processing method
- **Self-critique enhancement** for complex projects with multiple documents
- **Simple analysis** for basic projects with minimal content
- **Transparent cost** - always shows API calls used

### ðŸŽ¯ **Actionable Insights**
- **PRD â†” Tickets** - Requirements vs implementation alignment
- **Strategy â†” PRD** - Business goals vs product features alignment
- **PRFAQ â†” Functionality** - Customer messaging vs actual capabilities
- **Timeline Consistency** - Dates and milestones across documents

## What We Analyze

**Document Relationships:**
- **PRD to Tickets:** Are implementation tickets aligned with requirements?
- **Strategy to PRD:** Do product features support business objectives?
- **PRFAQ to PRD:** Does customer messaging match actual functionality?
- **Cross-Document:** Are timelines, priorities, and scope consistent?

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Documents that could benefit from individual improvement
- Suggestions to use [DocMint](https://docmint.repl.co) for content enhancement
- Structural improvements for better alignment

## Quick Start

### **Requirements**
- Claude API key (get from Anthropic)
- Python 3.7+
- Documents in supported platforms

### **Replit Setup** (Recommended)
1. Fork this project on Replit
2. Add your secrets in the ðŸ”’ Secrets tab:
   ```
   CLAUDE_API_KEY = your_claude_api_key_here
   ```
3. Run the app and start connecting documents!

### **Local Setup**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docsync.git
cd docsync
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
echo "CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Run application
python main.py
```

### **Configuration Options**
```bash
# Required
CLAUDE_API_KEY = your_api_key_from_anthropic

# Optional (recommended defaults)
CLAUDE_MODEL = claude-3-sonnet-20240229  # Balanced cost/quality
SECRET_KEY = your_session_secret          # For Flask sessions

# Platform API keys (optional - for enhanced integrations)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = your_google_client_secret
JIRA_API_KEY = your_jira_api_key
LINEAR_API_KEY = your_linear_api_key
```

## Usage Flow

### **1. Connect Documents**
